### Purpose of this Project

Adjective is a game engine started by myself to help alleviate some of the monotony you have to deal with when making an RPG from scratch. Much of the system makes it simple for anyone, even relative beginners, to get a simple game going as quickly as possible. Instead of focusing on graphics and more 'showy' aspects of game development, this package is intended to be used to set up your backend API and/or server. 

It is written in mostly Javascript and Ruby. I am mainly using Angular and Node.js for this part of the project. I am going to use CreateJS and animations in jQuery to clean up a lot of the UI design once I have features fleshed out. 

### As of right now, the front end is not styled, but has basic functionality working. I am in the process of setting up the file structure. The default combat engine is being rewritten from it's original form to support varied amounts of characters and/or enemies. The whole point is to make this thing as dynamic as possible while keeping a solid foundation of generated code to work from.
